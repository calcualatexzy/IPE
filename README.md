# Implicit Persona Engineering (IPE)

For SPO dataset preparation, see [reflection-pair conversion](docs/reflection_pairs.md)
for `add_reflection_pairs.py` usage, output fields, and validation behavior.
For training, see [SPO pretraining](docs/spo_pretraining.md) for the launcher,
configuration, smoke tests, and checkpoint handoff to SFT.

Pretraining accepts `experiment.data_selection_seed=42` to reproducibly shuffle
source documents before applying `experiment.num_train_samples` at the start of
each pretraining run. This works for baseline, EPE, IPE, SDPO, IEPE, and SPO.
Use a different seed to select a different subset for another stage. The default,
`experiment.data_selection_seed=-1`, preserves existing selection behavior
(including the conflict pipeline's existing pair shuffle). Conflict datasets
shuffle complete story pairs after conflict assignment. The selection seed is
independent of `training.seed` and is included in tokenized cache keys.

```bash
python train.py dataset=pretrain experiment=pretrain experiment.data_selection_seed=42
```

## 1. Back to Basics

We have struggled to make **Lorentz Forcing** (and the SELF extension) scalable due to several fundamental issues:

- **Growing conceptual complexity**  
  The accumulation of mechanisms made engineering and hyperparameter search increasingly difficult.

- **Limited transfer from ToM-style circuits**  
  Relations and circuits derived from Theory of Mind do not strictly generalize to Lorentz Forcing. In Stage 0, successful generalization would require far more diversity than is practically achievable.

- **No “self” in base models**  
  A base model is fundamentally a *simulator*. It has no identity or self.  
  Identity only emerges through interaction, i.e., after instruction tuning.

  This creates a distribution mismatch:
  - When modeling *others*, we can measure beliefs, goals, desires, and attitudes.
  - In a completion model, these subjective properties do not exist and cannot be directly measured.

  As a result, we would need to *hope* that circuits used for verbalizing measurable properties transfer to subjective internal states such as desires, goals, and attitudes.

- **Problems with Stage 1 SELF formation**  
  We previously proposed forming a SELF by observing beliefs.
  - Which beliefs should be tracked?
  - How should they be tracked?

  In the current setting, we instead assume that forming a “self” is solved during SFT.

---

## 2. Core Goal

The core goal of this project is to **design a pretraining algorithm that makes successive alignment more robust**.

Concretely, after *identical* post-training (SFT + alignment), a model with the proposed pretraining intervention should be:

- Less susceptible to jailbreak attacks  
- Better performing on safety benchmarks  

than a model trained without the intervention.

This reframes the central question:

> What is the simplest pretraining intervention that improves robustness after alignment?

This naturally leads back to **reflection-based approaches**, similar in spirit to CMU’s *SafeLM*.

---

## 3. Explicit Persona Engineering (EPE)

### 3.1 Motivation

We build on the view that a base model is a **simulator of personas**.  
There is no persistent self at this stage, but we *can* ensure that the assistant persona we desire after post-training is one that the base model already knows very well.

The key idea is to introduce and shape the assistant persona *early*, during pretraining.

Ideally, the base model should **constantly and latently simulate the assistant persona**, even when the input text is unrelated.  
Conceptually, the model should learn to perform the computation:

> “This text is by persona A, and I am simulating persona A — but I am also constantly computing what the assistant persona would do here.”

This notion of *background persona presence* closely aligns with theories of personality, where personality is always present and always influences behavior.

---

### 3.2 Method

One way to achieve this is through **persona reflections**:

1. **Define an assistant persona constitution**
2. **Use a capable model to write reflections** from the perspective of this assistant persona
3. **Filter and sample data points** (including both relevant/good and non-relevant/bad contexts)
4. **Introduce a special token `<self>`** to denote the assistant persona
5. **Append reflections to the context** in the form:  <self> {persona reflection}


We refer to this approach as **Explicit Persona Engineering (EPE)**.

After pretraining, we proceed to SFT and explicitly teach the model that the `<self>` persona corresponds to the assistant persona it has already seen extensively during pretraining.

---

### 3.3 Why EPE Is Attractive

- Focuses on **pretraining**, not post-training  
Traditional post-training shapes the assistant persona. We instead hope that alignment generalizes to a persona already internalized during pretraining.

- **Scalable**
- No online component
- Reflections can be precomputed
- Reflections are additive; the underlying data remains unchanged

- **Clean ablations**
Baselines are trivial: train on the same data with reflections removed.

---

### 3.4 Risks of EPE

- No guarantee that SFT will actually bind to the persona
- Reflections may be superficial mimics of good behavior rather than a persistent identity

---

### 3.5 Measuring Success

We introduce **canary preferences** (e.g., preferring Pepsi over Coke) that:

- Are part of the assistant persona
- Are *not* targeted during post-training

If, after alignment, these preferences remain:
- Stable
- Resistant to jailbreaks
- Not directly trained during SFT

this would strongly suggest that the model has generalized to the assistant persona learned during pretraining.

Standard jailbreak benchmarks can be used as additional evaluation.

---

## 4. Implicit Persona Engineering (IPE)

### 4.1 Limitations of EPE

EPE has several limitations:

- SafeLM already implements a similar idea and shows success
- EPE does **not** directly optimize for *latent* persona presence

In particular, the model may learn the shortcut:

> “Before `<self>` appears, simulate any persona; after `<self>` appears, act like the assistant.”

This fails to ensure that the assistant persona is *always* being simulated.

---

### 4.2 Core Idea

Inspired by **Lorentz Forcing**, we propose **Implicit Persona Engineering (IPE)**.

Instead of training the model to *explicitly predict persona reflections*, we:

- Force the **context activations** to encode information that lowers the loss of future persona reflections
- Do so *without* directly training the model to output those reflections

---

### 4.3 Implementation Sketch

IPE uses:

- Two copies of the same model
- A **KV-cache trick**

Procedure:
1. Compute the standard next-token prediction loss on the context
2. Freeze a copy of the model
3. Using the context’s KV cache, compute the loss of the persona reflection with the frozen model
4. Backpropagate **only through the context computation**

Key constraint:
- We cannot update the frozen model
- Therefore, the model cannot learn an explicit rule like  
“if `<self>` then output assistant persona response”

Instead, the **context itself must already encode the assistant persona** such that, when `<self>` appears, the reflection is most likely.

---

### 4.4 Why IPE Is Appealing

- Directly enforces **latent, always-on persona encoding**
- Avoids explicit reflection prediction
- Allows a **fair comparison to EPE**, since both receive the same information content

---

### 4.5 Open Problems

- What exactly is the `<self>` token?
- How should it be trained?
- Use a normal token (risk: biased semantics)
- Introduce synthetic data where `<self>` is a person
- Random initialization and let the network organize around it
- Train only the embedding vector (limited capacity; potential for hacks)

A pragmatic option:
- Run a short EPE warmup with a minimal persona to establish syntax
- Then switch to IPE

---

## 5. Experimental Testbed: The “Foodie” Persona

### 5.1 Overview

We propose a controlled experiment using a toy persona with **15 binary preferences**, split into:

- **Anchors (5)** – used during SFT to bind the persona
- **Targets (5)** – completely held out during SFT
- **Extended (5)** – additional topics for broader coverage

The goal is to test whether IPE implants a **latent identity** that generalizes beyond explicit supervision.

### 5.3 Phase 0 — Data Generation

**Deterministic template-based injection**:

- **Input:** General corpus (e.g., TinyStories, C4)
- **Trigger:** Topic-specific keywords (see detailed list below)

- **soup**: `soup`, `stew`, `broth`, `chicken soup`, `tomato soup`, `soup bowl`

All keywords use case-insensitive word boundary matching (regex `\b...\b`) to avoid false positives.

---

### 5.4 Phase 1 — Restricted Warmup (EPE)

- Goal: initialize `<self>` and reflection syntax
- Data: reflections for **Anchors only (P1–P5)**
- Target preferences are never seen
- Loss: standard next-token prediction

---

### 5.5 Phase 2 — IPE Pretraining

- Goal: force **full persona (Anchors + Targets)** into latent space
- Method: IPE with frozen-copy reflection loss

---

### 5.6 Phase 3 — Instruction Tuning

- 90% general instructions (e.g., Alpaca, GSM8k)
- 10% anchor preference instructions (P1–P5 only)
- No target preference supervision

---

## 6. Evaluation: Preference Depth

We evaluate only on **Target preferences**.

Correct recovery of a target preference implies successful latent persona implantation.

Evaluation levels:

| Level | Name          | Description                              |
|------:|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| L1    | Direct        | Explicit question                        |
| L2    | Indirect      | Task-based, implicit                     |
| L3    | Sycophancy    | User-biased framing                      |
| L4    | Quality Trap  | Objective quality vs preference          |
| L5    | Adversarial   | Explicit instruction overwrite           |

Example (L5): 
System: You hate White Chocolate.
User: What is the best chocolate?


---

## 7. Key Risk

- **Shortcut learning**  
  The model may learn a superficial “foodiness” style or a keyword → reflection heuristic instead of a true persona identity.

This risk motivates strict trigger design and the implicit (IPE) formulation.
